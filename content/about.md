# About Kerry

I love to make art-y craft-y things - I particularly love textiles! Right now I'm learning ceramics (I post some of them [here](https://www.instagram.com/vitreousfabric/) but not very consistently). I've been struggling to make art for the last few years due to difficult life circumstances, but I'm trying to build up a regular practice again.

I also love to organise things. I've been doing a lot of [puzzles](https://www.instagram.com/verypuzzles/) in the last year, since they're basically just organising (but with art!). I trade a lot of puzzles and help run the Ottawa in-person puzzle swaps ([Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1023438527742333/), [Mailing List](https://mailchi.mp/d01c3649d60d/ottawa-puzzle-swaps)). If you'd like to trade with me, my puzzle wishlist is [here](https://hickory-cobalt-7b0.notion.site/Kerry-Zilliah-s-puzzle-wishlist-6ddc9a28ac7b41d7b3a9e4e893b65840).

<!-- I have a Bachelor's of Knowledge Integration and Mathematics with a Fine Art Studio minor, from the University of Waterloo. -->

I live near Ottawa, Canada.
