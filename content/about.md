# About Kerry

I love to make art-y craft-y things - I particularly love textiles! I've mostly been knitting socks and cross stitching recently.

Right now I'm making miniature ceramics in a microwave kiln. I'm very drawn to round and organic shapes, and am having a lot of fun experimenting with weird glaze combinations and raku in tin cans. You can see more of my ceramics and other art on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kerrysm.art/).

I teach various art and craft workshops at [Association Culturelle de Luskville](https://www.associationculturelleluskville.ca/en). I love getting people started with a new crafty hobby and am passionate about making art accessible to everyone.

I also love to organise things. I do a lot of [puzzles](https://www.instagram.com/verypuzzles/), since they're basically just organising (but with art!). 

I also [make websites](https://kerrysmart.ca/).

I live near Ottawa, Canada.
