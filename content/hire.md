# Hire Me

## Web Development

* Details at {{< social-link "Web Dev" >}}

## Organization

* Item organization - give me a set of physical or digital items and I'll organize them for you.
* Organizational design - have something you need to organize, but can't figure out how? I can design an organizational system to fit your needs.
* Data librarian services - ensuring files are appropriately located and named, creating standardized formatting and organizational systems.

## Wall Art Help

* Hanging services - do you have art sitting in your closet that never made it to your walls? Are you unsure where and how to hang things? I can come to your house and either hang it for you, or take you through the process of hanging it yourself.
* Art finding - I can find reasonably priced prints that fit your aesthetic.

## Lessons

I teach group and one-one one classes.

* Knitting - any level.
* Cross stitching - help choosing and starting your first project.
* Ukulele - learn to play basic songs.

## Art and Craft Commissions

If I can make it, I'll make one for you! Commissions can be as specific or vague as you like. Commissions can include:

* Knitting and crochet.
* Custom knitting patterns.
* Cross stitch and embroidery - framed or on garments/etc.
* Drawing, mixed media artwork.

## Rates

Since I do a broad variety of work, my rates vary depending on what you're looking for. I'm also open to barter and trades.

I'm open to collaboration, as long as it's "we build a project together" and not "I implement an idea you have." (I'm happy to implement your cool ideas, but that would fall under paid work.)

## How This Works

If you're interested in hiring me, the first step is to [contact me](/contact/ "Contact Me")!

Next, we'll discuss your ideas, needs, timeline, and budget. This can happen over video, text, or in person (vaccination proof required).

Before finalizing anything, I'll give you a quote or a proposal with a few different options. You can decide whether or not the proposal will work for you - there's no obligation to accept if it isn't what you're looking for.

Once we've found an agreement that works for both of us, I'll get started!
