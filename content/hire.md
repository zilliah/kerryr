## Rates

Since I do a broad variety of work, my rates vary depending on what you're looking for. I'm also open to barter and trades.

[Contact me](/contact/ "Contact Me") to discuss your needs and ideas!

I'm open to collaboration, as long as it's "we build a project together" and not "I implement an idea you have." (I'm happy to implement your cool ideas, but that would fall under paid work.)
