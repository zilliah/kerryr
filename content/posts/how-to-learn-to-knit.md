\[how to approach it, what's worth paying for and what isn't\]

\[maybe intro post to series?\]

1. hello, i'm a knitting teacher! here's how to approach learning to knit. overwhelming, many options, overview of what's useful and what isn't worth paying for. different for everybody, adjust as feels good.


1. will include a bunch of info, but mostly as context for explaining why you're learning a thing, or how to approach things. actual mechanical information not included
2. what is your goal? many reasons to learn to knit, what is important for you?

## what are the basics?

knit, purl, CO, BO

* what they are
* how they're used
* why you need to know them
* why start here?

* materials \[somewhere in here\]

## learn them in person

if at all possible, learn in person \[why\]

ideally, from someone who has taught before

***

furture posts:

* first project
* fixing mistakes
* ravelry
* working in the roudn vs flat
* basic fabric types
* resources (beyond knit and purl, principles of knitting, ravelry)
